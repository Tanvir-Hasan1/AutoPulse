## Development

### Running the App

You can start the project in multiple environments:

- **Expo Go app** (quickest for testing)
- **Android emulator**
- **iOS simulator**
- **Web browser**

```bash
npx expo start
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to open the app in your preferred environment.

### Other Scripts

- `npm run android` — Launches Android emulator
- `npm run ios` — Launches iOS simulator
- `npm run web` — Runs the app in your browser
- `npm run lint` — Runs linter for code quality
- `npm run reset-project` — Resets starter code, see below for details

## Usage Guide

- Start development by editing files in the `app/` directory.
- Routing is **file-based** using [expo-router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/).
- Reusable logic (hooks, constants) is organized for easy access and scalability.
- Use the scripts to reset or lint your project as needed.

### Resetting the Project

To create a fresh project state (remove starter code):
```bash
npm run reset-project
```
This moves starter code to `app-example/` and provides a blank `app/` directory for new development.
